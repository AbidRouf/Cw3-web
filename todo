LEARN OUTS:

1. Users should then be able to send a "friend request" to another user. These requests should also be sent via ajax. Requests need to be approved by the other user before the two users become friends.

(All ajax requests must be done using the fetch API (with async-await) and Vue to reactively update the page.)

2. Your project should include automated tests that test: (1) account creation / signup, (2) login and (3) editing all the user's data on their profile page, (4) users page, with testing of filtering by age, (5) sending a friend request, (6) login as the other user and accept the friend requests sent. You should use selenium-based tests for full end-to-end (E2E) testing.





AT THE END:
Outcome: Once fully tested, your application should be deployed to the EECS OpenShift platform (to be discussed in week 8) â€” one deployed app per team. Make sure your submitted application has at least 20 test users and at least 10 hobbies. Each group should submit the code including a README file which should contain:

list of group members, with a short description (one sentence) of what each member was assigned to do, and what they actually did in terms of contributing to the final deliverable
the URL of your deployed application (if deployed)
the username and password for the admin user
the username and passwords of at least 5 of the test users
